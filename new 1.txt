Server:
	Computers in the network that provides required services to the client (other devices on the network).
	Can provide many functions like
		web and http services
		email services
		authentication services and so on.
Client Side rendering:
	Used when it comes to dynamic content.
	Initial request loads the page, layout, CSS and JS.
	The request is redirected to a single HTML file and the server will deliver it  without any content until all the JS is fetched and then let the browser to compile  everything before rendering the content.
	Thus, it takes time to load the pageview but becomes interactable quickly.
	
Server Side Rendering:
	Used when intended to work with a great deal of data.
	Initial request loads the page, layout, CSS, JS along with the content (data).
	When a web page is built, the server compiles everything including the data and then deliver a fully functional HTML page to the client.
	Loads the pageview quickly but takes time to become interactable.
	The server had to work all over again, everytime it is navigated to another route.
